  <h1>Cities Lived</h1>
  <p>I came to live in these cities because that is the
  way the tides took me. Some had to do with parents moving when
  I was younger. Others were more conscious decisions</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Atlanta, GA</li>
    <li>Warrenton, VA</li>
    <li>Pittsburgh, PA</li>
    <li>New York, NY</li>
    <li>Boulder, CO</li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Cities to Visit</h1>
  <p>I've been to a lot of places in the states. I would like to
  check out Portland bc it seems chill. Phoenix and Minneapolis I know
nothing about, but that's a good enough reason for me to want to visit</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Portland, OR</li>
    <li>Phoenix, AZ</li>
    <li>Minneapolis, MN</li>
  </ol>

  <h1>Cities Lived</h1>
  <p>I came to live in these cities because that is the
  way the tides took me. Some had to do with parents moving when
  I was younger. Others were more conscious decisions</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>Atlanta, GA<span>&#33;</span></em></li>
    <li><strong>Warrenton, VA<span>&#33;</span></strong></li>
    <li><em>Pittsburgh, PA<span>&#33;</span></em></li>
    <li><strong>New York, NY<span>&#33;</span></strong></li>
    <li><em>Boulder, CO<span>&#33;</span></em></li>
  </ul>
  <h1>Cities to Visit</h1>
  <p>I've been to a lot of places in the states. I would like to
  check out Portland bc it seems chill. Phoenix and Minneapolis I know
nothing about, but that's a good enough reason for me to want to visit</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Portland, OR<span>&#33;</span></li>
    <li>Phoenix, AZ<span>&#33;</span></li>
    <li>Minneapolis, MN<span>&#33;</span></li>
  </ol>
